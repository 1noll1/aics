# Choosing a project

Here are some things to think about when choosing your project:

 - For finding a topic have a look at my overview slides, the papers in the Documents section and the ideas we have already been discussing in the seminar
 - Do some research on Google scholar for new papers related to these topics, and search online for corpora and code in this area
 - Look for a project that is a language technology project that builds on your existing knowledge but bridges to computer vision and robotics - it should be a new challenge for you but at the same time you should feel comfortable that you can do it
- The more specific you are in your project description, the better, but of course things will be open at this stage as weâ€™re just starting. Think about the following questions: What is the problem that you are solving? What existing resources (datasets and code are there)? What tasks do you need to do to get the answers? What is the expected result?
